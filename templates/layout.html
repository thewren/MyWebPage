			Whiteness of the Whale
		</div>

		<div class= "blogpostbody">
			Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any manâ€™s soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.
